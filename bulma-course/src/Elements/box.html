            <p>
              And you as well must die, beloved dust, And all your beauty stand
              you in no stead; This flawless, vital hand, this perfect head,
              This body of flame and steel, before the gust Of Death, or under
              his autumnal frost, Shall be as any leaf, be no less dead Than the
              first leaf that fell,—this wonder fled. Altered, estranged,
              disintegrated, lost. Nor shall my love avail you in your hour. In
              spite of all my love, you will arise Upon that day and wander down
              the air Obscurely as the unattended flower, It mattering not how
              beautiful you were, Or how beloved above all else that dies.

            <p>
              O my Luve is like a red, red rose That’s newly sprung in June; O
              my Luve is like the melody That’s sweetly played in tune. So fair
              art thou, my bonnie lass, So deep in luve am I; And I will luve
              thee still, my dear, Till a’ the seas gang dry. Till a’ the seas
              gang dry, my dear, And the rocks melt wi’ the sun; I will love
              thee still, my dear, While the sands o’ life shall run. And fare
              thee weel, my only luve! And fare thee weel awhile! And I will
              come again, my luve, Though it were ten thousand mile.

            <p>
              I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I Did, till we loved? Were we
              not weaned till then? But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?
              Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den? ’Twas so; but this, all
              pleasures fancies be. If ever any beauty I did see, Which I
              desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee. And now good-morrow
              to our waking souls, Which watch not one another out of fear; For
              love, all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room
              an everywhere. Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, Let
              maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown, Let us possess one
              world, each hath one, and is one.
